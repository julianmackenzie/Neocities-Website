## 9/8/24 6:31pm
- Heart Tank Button now comes in 31x31. Get!

## 9/8/24 6:00pm
- This is your changelog speaking. Clicking the header of the mini-log will now take you to an entire page dedicated to reading me! There are quite a few funny bits of banter interspersed throughout these logs, so give 'er a better look with this new page!

## 9/8/24 4:56pm
- I just spent ages refactoring the site so that elements common to multiple pages (navigation, sidebars, etc.) are separate HTML files loaded via JavaScript. The issue with it was that the scripts I have, the theme switcher and changelog loader, HAD to be run in the base HTML file and would not work in the abstracted component files. So, I had to rewrite them both to work from the base file and wait for shit in the loaded ones.
- This approach means that making new pages and updating the common elements of all pages will be much easier and more organized. However, it make take a split second longer for pages to load the common content. A worthy trade-off.
- This fucking sucked.
- Next, we'll see if my scripts break when on inner pages since I have my non-index HTML files in /pages. I think I've prepped them to function inside an inner directory but I can't be sure.

## 9/8/24 3:20pm
- A healthy little easter egg has been added (as well as a kindred button).

## 9/8/24 12:30pm
- Purity. The Cave Story theme has been added. I may make recolors of this text box... maybe.


## 9/4/24 6:18pm
- Theme switcher added! Using JS and a lot of Googling, I have added the ability to switch between any of the 8 Chrono Trigger text boxes. Enjoy!


## 9/4/24 12:42pm
- The site is now <i>slightly</i> responsive. Boxes at least fit their content on mobile.


## 9/3/24 11:54pm
- I have added an asset from my previous site project, the "JMessage", to the site. It's a sprite edit of Curly Brace from Cave Story that looks a lot like myself! For now, it has a WIP message, but eventually, I would like to use this space as a MOTD!
- The JMessage box has inspired a new button and stamp, as well! For now, I think I would like this to be the primary button that leads to my site. But the Balrog Button is still the OG! Pour one out for the toaster
- Stamps are now chilling on da left. Who knows how long they'll stay, catch em while you can!


## 9/3/24 12:56pm
- A chatbox has been added to the site! It's so cool to see the page coming together one piece at a time. I have a lot of fun adding one or two cool things each day!


## 9/2/24 6:42pm
- This is your changelog speaking. I am no longer HTML-based, taking up lots of space anywhere I wish to appear! Instead, I am recorded in a Markdown file and rendered as HTML via Christopher Jeffrey's popular <a href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked/marked.min.js" target="_blank">Markdown-to-HTML</a> script!
- Additionally, sections of the site have their own individual borders now!
- The right sidebar is now large enough to fit two 88x31 buttons side-by-side.
- Links now open redirects in a new tab when appropriate and are no longer purple as hell

## 9/2/24 3:07pm
- The original prototype Balrog Button has been replaced by Balrog Stamp. This is the most important update ever, to any site, of all time.

## 9/2/24 2:25pm
- Fuck limitless potential. I have added borders to constrain the content of this page!!! Nah but for real tho? Chrono Trigger text boxes go nutty. I've added the default one, and will make a theme switcher some day.
- Also? Big button rewrite. Balrog and Hank no longer are a button wrapped in an anchor (troglodyte ass HTML).

## 9/2/24 1:33pm
- An 88x31 version of Hank button is here. Click it if you dare. hank site.

## 9/1/24 4:47pm
- Hank button added. Check out his neocities site <a href="https://thehank.neocities.org/" target="_blank">here!</a> (or click the hank button)

## 9/1/24 3:45pm
- The site was given a fresh coat of font with the Tektur paint. I mean a font coat of paint. I mean a sorry mommy i mean mommy im sorry i mean mommy sorry mommy uhhh yeah new font

## 8/31/24 11:59pm
- This is the changelog speaking. I am no longer taking up the main content area. Instead, I have found this conventient little box to sit inside of! Look for me over here if you want to know what's going on!

## 8/31/24 4:16pm
- Guestbook icon added. I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map, I'm the map. I'm the map.
- This icon may end up elsewhere, or nowhere. It's the closest Guestbook-adjacent art I've made.

## 8/31/24 4:00pm
- I've tuned up my buttons a bit and added a Guestbook link! I love all of these little widgets I see on other sites. I'll add a chat box eventually, and a page with my own buttons and assets on it!

## 8/31/24 1:45pm
- Balrog button 31x31ified. God wanted me to tell you to play Cave Story.

## 8/31/24 1:22pm
- Balrog button 88x31ified. I have confronted God on my own terms. She's black.

## 8/30/24 8:35pm
- BALROG BUTTON OPTIMIZED. BILLIONS STRICKEN WITH RAPTUROUS FITS OF MIRTH.

## 8/30/24 7:28pm
- Balrog Button added. Millions rejoice.

## 8/30/24 5:00pm
- Clouds are now layered, with the page content sandwiched betwixt them. Fuck yes.

## 8/29/24 11:30pm
- Three-column layout created. I just learned a LOT about flex. I imported some navigation icons from a personal site from 2022 that I never finished.
- I also spent a good deal of time editing together a Moonsong cloud GIF and starry background. Sick!

## 8/29/24 10:00am
- Neocities discovered. How the hell did I not know about this sooner.
